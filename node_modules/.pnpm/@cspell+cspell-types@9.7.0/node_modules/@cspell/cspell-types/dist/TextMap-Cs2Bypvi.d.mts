/**
* A SourceMap is used to map or transform the location of a piece of text back to its original offsets.
* This is necessary in order to report the correct location of a spelling issue.
* An empty source map indicates that it was a 1:1 transformation.
*
* Non-1:1 transformations are considered to be a single segment and cannot be split.
*
* A partial index into a non-linear segment will get mapped to the start of the segment.
*
* To signal a non-1:1 transformation a 0,0 pair can be used in the source map. This indicates that the
* following segment is a non-linear transformation and should not be split.
*
* This is important when multiple transformations have been applied to the same text, and the source map
* is being used to map back to the original text.
*
* For example: `\u00e9` might be transformed to `é` in one transformation and then to HTML entity `&#233;`.
* The resulting sourceMap would be `[..., 0, 0, 6, 6, ...]` to indicate that the 6 character segment should
* not be split when mapping back to the original text.
*
* The values in a source map are number pairs (even, odd) relative to the beginning of each
* string segment.
* - even - span length in the source text
* - odd - span length in the transformed text
*
* Offsets start at 0
*
* Example:
*
* - Original text: `Grand Caf\u00e9 Bj\u00f8rvika`
* - Transformed text: `Grand Café Bjørvika`
* - Map: [9, 9, 6, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 5, 5]
*
* | offset | span | original    | offset | span | transformed |
* | ------ | ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | ----------- |
* | 0-9    |    9 | `Grand Caf` | 0-9    |    9 | `Grand Caf` |
* | 9-15   |    6 | `\u00e9`    | 9-10   |    1 | `é`         |
* | 15-18  |    3 | ` Bj`       | 10-13  |    3 | ` Bj`       |
* | 18-24  |    6 | `\u00f8`    | 13-14  |    1 | `ø`         |
* | 24-29  |    5 | `rvika`     | 14-19  |    5 | `rvika`     |
*
* Note: The trailing 5,5 is not necessary since it is a 1:1 mapping, but it is included for clarity.
